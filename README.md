## Heading Tags

When we are using `heading` tags in our website or web pages.We should avoid some **mistakes** : 
1. Dont repeat a `heading` which is already used before some where in the page until, unless you finish using all the headings from **level 1** to **level 6**.

```html
<h1>Hey it's me.....!! Level one heading</h1>
<h1>Another One.....!!</h1>
```
2. We cannot skip any heading, they should be used in sequence.
```html
<h1>i Like heading One</h1>
<h4>blahhh...blahhh...</h4>
```
